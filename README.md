# OneShot-Script-Wrapper
A custom workspace intended for better inter-mod compatibility and easier git merges

# Installation
OneShot-Script-Wrapper (for the moment) needs ruby 2.7+ installed on your system and, Powershell.
In addition to those, you will need to allow for local ps1 scripts to be run on your system.

See:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies

You will also need several ruby gems. You can aquire them by using ``gem install <gem>``.
```
json
ruby-progressbar
fileutils
pathname
readline
zlib
oj
```

After you finish with those, download the latest release from https://github.com/Speak2Erase/OneShot-Script-Wrapper/releases/latest, and place it inside your OneShot folder.
